This week I read an article about [Precious Plastics][precious_plastics], an
open source project with the goal of allowing anyone in the world to create
value from plastic waste. Precious plastics provides the blueprints and
installation instructions for recycling machines which people can operate in
their communities and homes. Additionally, they have setup a community in which
people can obtain help. A main goal of precious platiscs is to make the
recycling machines easily affordable such that the average person can easily
afford to buy them. 

The Precious Plastics project greatly benefits from being a part of the open
source community. By making their designs open source, other memebers of the
community can improve on the design and publish it back to the rest of the
community. There is also a sub community that has formed where people are
openly sharing ideas for things they can create with the plastic the recycle.
The community that Precious Plastics is growing is key to helping them spread
their message and reach their goal.

Today I atteneded a meeting of the RIT Linux Users Group (RITLUG). This week,
they had a presentation on the use of gpg/pgp which went over some fundamentals
of key based encryption, how to setup a pgp key, and even some best practices.

After the presentation there was time for a open discussion and hangout. One
interesting topic being discussed was how to verify someone's identity during a
key signing party. Particularly, an argument was presented that it could be
unfair to require someone to show you their license before you sign thier key,
as it creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for people who may not have one.
A high schooler for example may be more likley to not have a good form of physical identification.

Services like [keybase.io][keybase] offer a solution to this problem as users verify their
identity by linking their social media accounts. Although, it would be
interesting to see a service like keybase incorporated into an in-person key
siging event.

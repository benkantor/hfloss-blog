### List your other team members below

| Name         | Email           |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| Craig Cabrey | xxxxxxx@rit.edu |
| Ben Kantor   | xxxxxxx@rit.edu |
| Jim Arnold   | xxxxxxx@rit.edu |

### Which project did your team choose?

A 2D platformer where the player must solve problems in order to make progress in the world. Our original concept involved the player as a hurdler trying to “hurdle” math problems to win the race.


### What will each team member's role be?

#### Jim Arnold

* Graphics Wizard
* Game Design Consultant

#### Ben Kantor

* Game Logic Developer
* Manage project scope and requirements

#### Craig Cabrey

* Python Consultant
* Linux Consultant

### Source Code Repository URL?

[https://github.com/craigcabrey/math-hurdler][github]

### What are the easy parts?

* Scaffolding out the base project thanks to sugar quickstart.
* Idenitifying the scope of the game.
* Some python experience on the team.

### What are the hard parts?

* General lack of experience with pygame.
* Team coordination.

### How will you overcome both?

In order to learn PyGame, we plan to go over some tutorials available online.
There are PyGame tutorials available on the [PyGame website][pygame_website]
and we found a tutorial for making a Sugar activity with PyGame on
[flossmanuals][flossmanuals].

We will be using Facebook Messanger, email, and the Github issue tracker to
communicate. In addition to those virtual sources, we also plan to meet after
class on Mondays and Wednesdays.

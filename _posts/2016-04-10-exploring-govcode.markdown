While reading Hacker News this week, I came across an article where someone
created an open source version of the TSA Randomizer. A reference to the recent
news that the [government spent $47,000 dollars][randomizer] on an app with the
simple feature of randomly switching between a left and right arrow in order to
place people in lines at airpoint security checkpoints.

Gross misspending of money aside, I became curious to find out if the U.S.
Government was involved with any open source projects. A quick google search
brought me to [Govcode][govcode]; a website the features open source projects
by the U.S. Government.

Upon first inspection, the Govcode website offers a lot of useful features for
someone who would be interested in contributing to an open source project.
Users can search for projects based on the programming languages they know,
project name, and amount of Github activity. There is even a section that links
to Github issues for projects in need of help. 

Unfortunately there are several glaring issues with the website which indicate
that it's no longer being maintained. Many of the listed projects and issues
are repeated 3 to 5 times which makes finding a project more difficult.
Additionally, many of the statistics on the site such as the total number of
projects, contributors, and issues are wildly inaccurate. Govcode itself is
hosted on [Github][govcode_github] and when I navigated to their respository, I
found that the issues I was encountering had already been reported over a year
ago with no response. 

Dispite several issues, I would say that Govcode is still a useful tool for
someone wishing to contibute to an open source project.

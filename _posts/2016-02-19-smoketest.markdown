For this assignemnt I was tasked with running a smoketest on a XO One Laptop
Per Child (OLPC) laptop.

The smoketest instructions can be found
[here.](http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Smoke_test/11.2.x/1_hour_smoke_test)

### Startup & Activities

For the most part, I didn't encounter many difficulties doing the basic laptop
startup and running through the basic activities. I found that the biggest
challenige was getting familiar with the XO's interface as it was a very
difference than any other computer I have experienced. After a while though,
I got the hang of it and began navigating very quickly through the neighborhood
, group, and user screens.

I was successfully able to open up and use all of the activities as perscribed
in the smoketest instructions.

### Image Transfer & Invite

This part of the smoketest involved dowloading an image from the internet,
placing the image in a journal write activity and then sharing the write
acitivity with another XO user to enable collaborative editing.

To connect with another XO user, I worked with another student in the class and
we both connected to the same AD-HOC network. This step was fairly easy to do.

In trying to invite each other to our journal writing activities we ran into a
few problems. When sending the invite to each other, we found that sometimes
the XO wouldn't see the invite. 

The collaborative edit mode while mostly functional was very slow to update
changes to the other user's activity. Additionally, any edits made to photos
were not seen in the other user's activity at all.

# Collaborative Chat

The collaborative chat activity was easy to setup and connect to using both
XO's.

# Collaborative Distance

The collaborative distance activity was just as east to setup and connect to as
the collaborative chat activity. The activity causes the XO's to play loud
chirps and then listens to those chirps to record distance. While the activity
worked it requires a quiet room or the measurement will be affected by other
noises going on in the room.

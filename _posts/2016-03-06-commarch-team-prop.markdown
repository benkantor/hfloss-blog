## List your other team members below

| Name         | Email           |
|:-------------|:----------------|
| Ben Kantor   | bdk3079@rit.edu |
| Craig Cabrey | cac2573@rit.edu |
| Jim Arnold   | jra2196@rit.edu |

## Which project did your team choose?

`systemd`

## 2-liner description of the project?

systemd is an init system for Linux. According to their [website][website],
systemd provides a system and service manager, which “offers on-demand starting
of daemons, keeps track of processes using Linux control groups, supports
snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount
points and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service
control logic.”

## What will each team member's role be?

* **Craig**
  * Record all research link
  * Questions 4A, B, C, D, G, H, I, J, K, N, O, P
* **Ben**
  * Generate project report using git_by_a_bus
  * Question 4E
  * Question 4L

  * Calculate your project's "Callaway Coefficient of Fail"
  * Question 4F
* **Collaborative Group Work**

## Source Code Repository URL?

[https://github.com/systemd/systemd][github]

## How will you communicate with them?

* IRC on irc.freenode.org (#systemd)

* Issue tracker on [Github][github]

* [Mailman][mailman] mailing list

## What are the easy parts?

* Git-by-a-bus seems easy to use and will provide a lot of useful data.

* From a first glance systemd is a large and actively contributed to project
with a lot of helpful resources and documentation.

## What are the hard parts?

* Questions about tracking contributors over time may be difficult depending on
how much data git-by-a-bus provides.

* Conflicting schedules may make it hard for the team to meet up for
collaborative work.

## How will you overcome both?

* We have split up the work in a way that everyone can complete some of the
work independently if necessary.

* We have agreed to meet up on Wednesday to ensure that we can finish the
collaborative work assignments. 


**Schedule**

* Mon Mar 7th 
  * Finish all individual work
* Wed Mar 9th
  * Meet and finish collaborative questions and create slides
* Fri Mar 11th
  * Present slides
  * Submit individual write-ups

This past weekend I went to [BrickHack2](https://brickhack.io/), RIT's second
annual 24 hour hackathon organized entirely by students in the codeRIT
organization. As one of the primary organizers for the first BrickHack, it was
great to see how well this one turned out from a participants perspective.

Looking around BrickHack, there is a noticably large presence of the Free and
Open Source Software Community (FOSS). There were several representatives from
Mozilla and Fedora providing mentorship to participants. There was even a Best
in FOSS prize to encourage teams to work on an open source project.

For those new to the open source community, Remy DeCausemaker, the Fedora
Community Action and Impact Lead at Red Hat, gave a tech talk entitled
*Free/Open Source Software Submissions: A Primer. How to license your code
FOSS, how to contribute to FOSS projects, how to specifically do things "The
Open Source Way."* The talk was certainly helpful to participants who were
thinking about doing an open source project, but didn't really know what they
should be doing to accomplish that.

Overall. I think BrickHack2 was a prime example of why it's important for the
FOSS community to be present at hackathons. At an event with 400 hackers from
different colleges, with the full gambit of experience from first time hackers
to 10+ hackathon veterans, hackathons provide an environment that is condusive
to spreading FOSS knowledge and culture.

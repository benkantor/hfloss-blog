Today I atteneded another meeting of the RIT Linux Users Group (RITLUG). This week,
they had a presentation on the Let's Encrypt. Let's encrypt is a new service that
offers free SSL certifcates for anyone owning a domain.

Let's Encrypt seeks to solve some of the current problems associated with SSL
certificates which include large costs to obtain the certifcates and complicated
identity verification procedures. Let's Encrypt does this by providing free
domain verification to anoyone who owns a domain.

Let's Encrypt embraces free and open source culture as its certificate
management process is open source software. The project also came about as part
of a collaboration between several groups such as the Linux Foundation, Cisco, 
Mozilla, Facebook and the Electronic Frontier Foundation. By reducing the cost
of obtaining SSL certifcates, Let's Encrpt is able to faciliate greater use of
SSL which contributes to the overall security of the internet. Open sourcing 
the management process makes the verification proces more trasparent than 
closed source compoettiors.

In addtion to background info, the presenation also provided some helpful
tutorial for how to use Let's Encrypt.

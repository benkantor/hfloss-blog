So far this class has mostly been review for me.

I haven't used IRC before, but it was very straightforward to setup. I'm 
currently using the browser based version, but I will most likely switch to a
Linux client.

For this blog, I'm using Jekyll a FOSS static site generator that has good
support for blogging. I'm hosting my blog using Github pages because it is
free.

As hinted at above I'm well experienced with Github. I also have a Bitbucket
account but I have no public repos associated with it.

Patching the course project was easy as I well experienced with forking Github
repos and creating pull requests. I did encounter some trouble with the
formatting of the people.yaml file as the example included in the repo
contained incorrect formatting.
